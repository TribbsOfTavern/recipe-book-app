## This is a work in progress

### Objective
Create a recipe book app that allows you to manage and adjust recipes. Scaling yeilds as needed.

---
### Why?
A viewer gave me this idea and I thought it would be fun and useful as a bit of a baker myself. Gives me a project to use tkinter and build a GUI application instead of a script.

---
### How to use?
Currently most the functionality doesn't work. You can check it our by running the **digital-recipe-book.py** file with python3.

There is another version which I originally started on stream, but after sometime I realized there would be a better way to do it without using seperate frame classes and having a ton of 'self.' variables and variable sharing was getting weird. You can check out that code in the **baker-calc-app.py.old** file.

I tried to make this pretty simple to use and all functionaly is currently in the menu bar. This could change over time.
